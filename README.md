# Life expectancy and GDP : Is it correlated ?

This project will investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens.

The goals are to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and seek to explain the findings from the study.

Here are a few questions that this project will seek to answer:

+ Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
+ Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
+ Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
+ What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
+ What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
